for all functions you first have to call the getConnection() function in CSDS.js

then that will return a client

Then you can use it in any of the function it is passed in as the second paramter

All functions will unbind with the client after they execute because it will

hang if you do not unbind

so you will have to establish a new connection each time you uses a function

there Three Examples.js files to show you how it is implemented

all data structures needed these functions are in the DataStructures.js file
